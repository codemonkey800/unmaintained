#### Introduction
Freshmen year is a huge year for many students. It's the year where they have to adapt to a
new social and academic environment (Ask me about my Humanities Honors classes and I'll
complain to you all day). But it's also pretty much the only time a student can have fun. Freshmen
year is typically the year where many students make the majority of their non-major friends,
whether it be through dorming, parties, frats, etc. 

But there's one thing that is for certain: it sucks being a Freshmen in Computer Science. 
*Well*... It sucks for students such as me. 

#### I Don't Want to Wait for School to Teach Me
When I said it sucks for students such as me, I wasn't trying to imply I was gifted
or intelligent. I'm clearly not gifted, and I'm probably not that smart. But I am a hard
worker. And I'm passionate enough to learn programming, computer science, and software development
on my own.

I came from a high school that lacked a proper computer science class. In fact, the only 
class that came off as computer science was a web design class, and we were only taught
how to drag and drop in Dreamweaver. I was that one kid who made things complicated by 
downloading Notepad++ and reading up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials on how to 
develop websites the *right* way.

I was passionate about learning programming. I didn't want to wait for school to teach me. 
Knowing that I was never going to get to learn computer science through school, I took it upon
myself to learn through various online resources and books.

#### But I'm Not The Only One!
I was often regarded as the *smart kid who knew computers* among my peers. And for a while, I 
believed it. But it wasn't until I got to college where I found out I wasn't the only one. 

I've met amazing people in my time here at SJSU. I've met some very intelligent freshmen
who also were amazing programmers. There were, more or less, just like me. They shared the
same passion for programming and taught themselves rather than wait for school to teach them.

Now wait. What is the *real* problem I'm getting at. Well, without digressing further, the
problem is the difficulty in attaining internships as a Freshmen.

#### An Internship?! But You're Just a Freshmen!
I agree. I am a freshmen. But I'm not an ordinary freshmen in computer science, but I sure
am not unique.

The problem, or rather, my complaint is that there's just a huge lacking of internships for
freshmen in computer science. I cannot count the amount of internships I applied for that
resulted in "You have an impressive resume, but we only want juniors and seniors because
you suck. Get rekt scrub #WaddupDoe."

Okay well, the last part never happens, but I can imagine that's what the hiring manager is 
thinking. Internships are just not inviting for freshmen. And the only internships
that *are* for freshmen usually require you to be from Stanford, Berkeley, or MIT 
(Trust me, it's true. But no one wants to admit it. My eyes are on you
[Google](http://goo.gl/dtUnmP)).

So essentially, freshmen such as myself essentially have no chance. Now personally, I *need* an
internship. Not only will I gain valuable experience to get another internship, but I'll
also get a whole lot of money. Yeah, it's selfish. But what's more selfish is that I can't
help my parents pay for my college while they work hard to put me through school.

#### What Companies Should Do
More companies should take the same route as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft by providing
internship oppurtunities for freshmen (Without the ridiculous bias for
students from top schools. Seriously, there are smart people here at SJSU). 

Internships, especially the first, is usually the first step to a successful 
career in software engineering. I'll admit, not all freshmen in computer science are ready
for such a position. But there are many who are, but are being ignored and overshadowed
by those from top universities.

If more companies did this, it'd provide a huge step forward for internships in the same boat
as me.

#### Conclusion
Talent, determination, and above all, passion, are not qualities inherent to the institution
a student attends, but rather to the student him or herself. 

Freshmen computer scientists from "lower tier" schools are being overshadowed, and
I say it should come to a stop.
