# SJSU Global Game Jam Spring 2015
Here's the unfinished game that my team tried to make during Global Game Jam Spring 2015. This is when we didn't know anything about game development and just tried because why not. Unfortunately we didn't finish and all we have is the idea.

# The Idea
The idea was to be a really meta game where the game was a gameified version of the Game Jam. Essentially you played as a developer/artist/manager/etc and developed the game in a game jam. We had stuff like skill levels, activities, etc. Maybe on day we'll finish it.

# Setting Up
If you want to--for some reason--contribute to the project, you can. The project requires Gradle. You can either open the project up in your favorite IDE (It better be Intellij) or build it from command line.
