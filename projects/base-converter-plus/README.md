BaseConverter+
=============

This is a redesign of my first Android app, [BaseConverter](https://github.com/codemonkey800/BaseConverter). I made
BaseConverter in my senior year. Now that Lollipop and Material Design is a thing, I wanted to redesign the app to test out Material Design.

Building
========
Building is simple. Just run
```
    gradle build
```
or import the project into Android Studio as a Gradle project, Gradle Sync, and build.

Excelsior!
