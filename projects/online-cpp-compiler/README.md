# Online C++ Compiler #

A simple HTML page that uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/).

The main component of the web app is the PHP backend. The server you use must support PHP, and to compile 
source code files, you must have a build of g++ on your system. Windows users can use [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).

I set up the compiler to compile source files under the C++11 standard and to be a static build. You can
change the settings in compile.php file as much as you want.
